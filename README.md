## Git vs. GitHub
 _**Git**_ is a version-control system software thats used by software developers to save "snapshots" of code and keeps track of changes made to code and computer files.  
 _**Github**_ is a website that runs on Git. Github stores "in the cloud" any committed files that are pushed to your remote repository on Github. The _remote_ repository on Github works as a backup repository incase you lose your _local_ repository on cloud9.

## Initial Setup
##### Description  
Making a Github account is the most crucial step in this tutorial. Without Github, you wont be able to sign in to Cloud9 using the second sign in method (the "Sign in through Github" method). You also wont be able to push your Cloud9 code to a remote repository because there is no remote repository due to the fact that **there is no account**. So lets get started!  
##### How to make a Github account
1. Click "Sign Up" next to the "Sign in"  button on the top right corner of the Github website Home menu.
2. Follow the directions included in the first slide (Step 1) of the "Sign Up" tutorial of the Github website.  

  * Make a username
  * Add/Link an external email account 
  * Create a Password
3. Now your are in slide 2 (Step 2). This slide asks you if you want to include a monthly personal plan to your Github account. There are 2 options:
* $0 Personal Plan
* $7 Personal Plan  
Buying the $7 plan will enable certain features that are not included in the $0 personal plan. In the $0 dollar plan you are have a limited amount of privileges  

Congrats! Now you made a github account. Now you last step is to set up your SSH Key.  

After you have created your account and chosen your plan, you will be redirected to your github settings. Your screen will look like this
